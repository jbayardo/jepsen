All of these instructions assume that your working directory is jepsen/docker/.

-------------------------------

In terminal 0:

sudo JEPSEN_ROOT="/home/user/jepsen" ./up.sh --dev

-------------------------------

In terminal 1:

sudo docker inspect jepsen-control | grep IPAddress

This will fetch the IP address of the jepsen-control host. Take note of it.

sudo docker exec -it jepsen-control bash
lein run serve

This sets up a web server so that you can look into the debug logs easily. Open your browser, and point it to the IP address we got from before at port 8080.

If you prefer to look into the log files manually, they are located in the .

-------------------------------

In terminal 2:

sudo docker exec -it jepsen-control bash
cd ravendb
lein run test

This effectively runs the test and creates the execution reports, which you can look at from the web server.
